Repo for Algorithms COMP20290 by 18359191 Luke Connelly

The Main.java file in this repo serves to give an overview of my work over the module's twelve weeks

To run Main, simply pull the project, ensuring all .java's and .txt's are in the same directory.

From here, you can use either command line or a JDK to compile and run my the files. Main should be run without
arguments, as it will prompt you for arguments as it calls other classes.

The other files can take arguments however they also all have defaults included in the event they are run without 
arguments or the given arguments are not supplied correctly.

The format for arguments is included as a comment at the top of each file.

Also included in this repo are two sorts, Priority Queue Sort and Heap Sort which I completed in my own time,
they are not essential to the course but I found them to be relevant and timed them out of my own interest.

The .docx files are also not essential, they are simply my answers to the bonus questions in the practicals,
which I committed before Mark marked them non-essential to the repo.

I hope you find these files to be easy reading, but if you have any questions, queries or concerns please
feel free to contact me at luke.connelly@ucdconnect.ie

Thanks very much,
Luke
