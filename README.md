# Repo for Algorithms COMP20290 by 18359191 Luke Connelly

This repo should give an overview of my work in the Algorithms Module over the past 12 weeks. All code is written in Java, the .docx files are not essential, they are simply my answers to the bonus questions in the practicals, which I committed before Mark marked them non-essential to the repo. Also included in this repo are two sort examples supplementary to the course, Priority Queue Sort and Heap Sort which I completed in my own time, but found to be relevant and timed them out of my own interest.

The Main.java file in this repo serves to give an overview of my work over the module's twelve weeks

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The code was written in Eclipse using Java 13, but should run on Java 8 or Java 13 in any Java friendly environment or JDK

### Running

To run Main, simply pull the project, ensuring all .java's and .txt's are in the same directory.

From here, you can use command line to compile and run the files. Compilation is done as follows:

- Navigate to the directory containing the files using cd foldername

```
cd 18359191_AssignmentFolder
```

- Compile every file by typing javac \*.java into the command line.

```
javac *.java
```

- Files can also be compiled individualy by typing javac filename.java into the command line.

```
javac RusPesAlg.java
```

- Now run the file by typing java filename followed by any wanted arguments. Arguments are not neccessary for any of the practicals files, but can be given for all but Main.java

```
java RusPesAlg.java 25 20
```

or

```
java Main.java
```

Alternatively a JDK can be used to build and run the files.

## Usage

Main should be run without arguments, as it will prompt you for arguments as it calls other classes.

The other files can take arguments however they also all have defaults included in the event they are run without 
arguments or the given arguments are not supplied correctly.

The format for arguments is included as a comment at the top of each file.

## Final Words

I hope you find these files to be easy reading, but if you have any questions, queries or concerns please feel free to contact me at luke.connelly@ucdconnect.ie

Thanks very much,

Luke
